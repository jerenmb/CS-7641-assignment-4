The code for this assignment can be found here: https://github.com/jerenmb/CS-7641-Assignment-4

This assignment was built using code taken from https://github.com/svpino/cs7641-assignment4 Thanks Santiago!

The code is contained within the assignment4 folder. 

This project was built with Java 1.8. 

To run the project, clone the repository and run a Maven clean on the project. This will install the BURLAP library along with any other necessary dependencies.
The README.md in this project was provided by Santiago, and contains detailed instructions on how to run the project and edit various parameters and settings.
Generally, the project can be run by editing a few parameters at the top of Main.java, including which problem you would like to solve (1 or 2) and which algorithm to run (ValueIteration, PolicyIteration, or QLearning).
After applying the desired settings, the project can be run by simply running Main.java as a Java application (for example from within Eclipse).

Running Main will produce results that can be used for analysis as well as a Java screen that shows the grid world problem, including estimated value for each state and optionally the policy identified by the learner.
Images and analysis captured from this method have been included in the artifacts folder.
